# Hodgkin-Huxley Model

## Introduction

The Hodgkin-Huxley model is a mathematical representation that explains how action potentials are generated and propagated in excitable cells, such as neurons. Developed by scientists Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley in 1952, the model utilizes a set of differential equations to describe the dynamics of ionic channels in the neuronal membrane.

## Key Concepts

- **Action Potential**: A rapid change in membrane potential that occurs when a neuron is stimulated.
- **Ionic Channels**: Proteins in the cell membrane that allow specific ions (Na⁺ and K⁺) to flow in and out of the neuron.
- **Equations**: The model consists of equations that quantify the behavior of sodium and potassium currents, as well as the membrane potential.

## Model Variables

- \( V(t) \): Membrane potential (mV)
- \( C_m \): Membrane capacitance (\(\mu F/cm^2\))
- \( I_{\text{ext}}(t) \): External current (\(\mu A/cm^2\))
- \( I_{\text{Na}} \): Sodium current
- \( I_{\text{K}} \): Potassium current
- \( I_{\text{L}} \): Leakage current
- \( m, h, n \): Activation and inactivation variables for ion channels

## Usage

This model can be implemented in various programming environments, such as Python or MATLAB, to simulate neuronal behavior under different conditions.
